# Strings, Patterns, and Regular Expressions

## Theory

* [Strings in C](c_strings.md)
* [Patterns](patterns.md)
* [Regular expressions](regexes.md)

## Outline

* Practice using functions of the C language to handle strings
* Practice using Shell patterns and regular expressions
    * Shell
    * C language

## Homework

_Write and submit to GitHub the program described below.
An instruction on how to work with GitHub is [here](../../../software/git.md)_.

### Task

Write a program that inputs three command-line arguments:

* `argv[1]` - regular expression;
* `argv[2]` - text;
* `argv[3]` - replacement.

The program finds all occurrences of the regular expression in the text and
replaces all of them with the specified replacement string.
The updated text is stored in a separate buffer and printed to the console in the end.

_Hint_: Algorithm is as follows. Allocate a buffer for the new text. Find a regular expression
match. Copy to the buffer text before match. Copy to the buffer replacement. Find the next
regular expression match and so on.

_Note_: The problem when the size of the allocated buffer is not enough to store the text
can be solved by using the [realloc](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/realloc.3p.html)
function to allocated additional space.
