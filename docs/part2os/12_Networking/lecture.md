http		80/tcp		www		# WorldWideWeb HTTP
https		443/tcp				# http protocol over TLS/SSL
https		443/udp				# HTTP/3
http-alt	8080/tcp	webcache	# WWW caching service
```

Viewing/editing the [/etc/hosts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29) file: 
```bash
cat /etc/hosts
127.0.0.1	localhost
127.0.1.1	huawei-ThinkPad-T490s
158.160.144.239	ejudge

# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

Querying DNS with [nslookup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nslookup):
```bash
nslookup hse.ru
Server:		127.0.0.53
Address:	127.0.0.53#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	hse.ru
Address: 178.248.234.104
```

Querying information on an IP address with [whois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHOIS):
```bash
whois 89.175.46.44
