Exam Questions
---

## Exam Rules

* The exam is oral: 40 minutes for a preparation and 10 minutes for an answer.
* No materials are allowed except for [RISC-V Greencard](
  https://github.com/andrewt0301/hse-acos-course/raw/master/related/greencard-20181213.pdf).
* Exam tickets include 3 questions:
  1. theoretical question on CA;
  2. theoretical question on OS;
  3. programming task (solved on a sheet of paper).

### Grading

__Grade = 0.3 * Theory_CA + 0.3 * Theory_OS + 0.4 * Programming__

### Hint

An answer to each question is expected to take ~3 minutes.
Theoretical questions contain a number of points (subquestions).
For many of them, a simple answer (1 sentence) is enough.
The exam checks your overall understanding of the main concepts.

## Programming

You need to write code in RISC-V assembly on a sheet of paper. You must be able to explain it.

White a function that takes two arguments:
* the pointer to an array of 32-bit integers (`a0`);
* the number of elements in the array (`a1`).

What the function should do is specified in your variant (the list of tasks is not published).

__NOTE__: When implementing a function be careful about callee-saved registers:
(1) do not modify them at all or (2) save them to the stack and then restore.

### Example Variant

The function computes the distance between the smallest and
the largest element in the array and returns it in (`a0`).

### Example Solution

See the `func` function in [this](exam.asm) file.
