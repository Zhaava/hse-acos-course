#### Exceptions and Interrupts

__Exception__ is an an unscheduled event that disrupts program execution.
__Interrupt__ is an exception that comes from outside of the processor.
 (Some architectures use the term interrupt for all exceptions.)
Exceptions require dealing with special system instructions and registers.

#### Control and Status Registers (CSRs)

The __Control and Status Registers (CSRs)__ are system registers provided by RISC-V to control monitor system states.
CSR’s can be read, written and bits can be set/cleared. 
Each CSR has a special name and is assigned a unique function.
In this course, we focus on the user privilege level.
We will use user-level CSRs to handle user-level exceptions.

__User-level CSRs__:

#### Exceptions

When an exception occurs the PC is written to the `uepc` register and
the exception cause code is written to the `ucause`.

  ```

#### Exception Handling

When an exception occurs the following actions are performed:

* the `uie` (interrupt enable) bit in the status word is set to `0`;
* the `ucause` register is set to indicate which event has occurred;
* the `uepc` is set to the last instruction that was executing when system trapped;
* the PC is set to `utvec` value;
  in case of vectored exception handling, the PC is set `utvec` base address + 4 * `utcause`.

In order to have a working exception handler, the program must:

* set `utvec` to the address of the handler code (the lowest two bits are special);
* set the bits corresponding to the handled interrupts in `uie`;
* set the interrupt enable (lowest) bit in `ustatus` to enable the handler. 

The simplest user-level exception handler that just returns control to the next (PC+4) instruction: 

```assembly
handler:
     # Just ignore it by moving uepc to the next instruction
     csrrw t0, uepc, zero
     addi  t0, t0, 4
     csrrw zero, uepc, t0
     uret
```

The user-level handler can be registered in the following way:

```assembly
     la     t0, handler      # load handler address to t0
     csrrw  zero, utvec, t0  # set utvec to the handlers address
     csrrsi zero, ustatus, 1 # set interrupt enable bit in ustatus
```

Interrupts are exceptions that come from external devices such as I/O devices.
These events can be handled. To do this, an interrupt must be enabled in the device and
a corresponding bit must be set in `uie`. See the examples to learn how this works.

#### Tasks

1. Study the theory and examples on the current workshop.

1. Implement an exception handler that prints a message that explains the reason of an exception
   (the list of exceptions with descriptions is above).

1. Image how the _try_-_catch_ construct is implemented in high-level languages.
   Then write a program that implements a simple function with an exception handler.
   The function takes an argument that specifies what exception it will raise
   (`0` - no exception, `1` - some exception from list above, `2` - some other exception from the list). 
   The function must return exception cause or 0 if no exception has occurred.
   The program prints the exception cause.

## Homework

Study the theory and the examples and finish the tasks.

1. Write a program that waits for timer interrupts and counts them. Input data: `m` is the limit on
   number of interrupts to process, `t` is the interval between interrupts in milliseconds.
   The program exits when the number of handler interrupts reaches the limit.

   _Hint_: Use the "Tools | Timer Tool" RARS extension. See its help. The MMIO address
   to get the current time `0xFFFF0018`; the MMIO address the set the time for the next
   interrupt is `0xFFFF0020`. To set up the cycle of processing interrupts, the following must be done:

   * The address of your interrupt handler must be stored in the `utvec` CSR.
   * The fourth bit of the `uie` CSR must be set to `1` (i.e. `ori uie, uie, 0x10`).
   * The zeroth bit of the `ustatus` CSR must be set to `1` (i.e. `ori ustatus, ustatus, 0x1`).
   * The time for the next interrupt must be written to `0xFFFF0020`.
   * When an interrupt is handled the time for the next interrupt must be updated.

1. __Bonus task (2 bonus points)__:

   How would you simulate multitasking using interrupts and timer?
   Write a program that contains two for-loops running in a semi-parallel mode.
   The first prints messages `Thread1: 0`..`Thread1: N` and the second prints messages `Thread2: 0`..`Thread2: N`.
   The program must use timer to switch between the threads.

   Hint: Each thread stores in memory (`.data` section) its PC and values of register it uses.
   When a timer interrupt occurs, the handler saves current register values, loads the new register values,
   and return control to the PC of the next thread. 

Commit the programs to your private GitHub account. Place them into the folder `ca/lab10`.
